TODO 

- Ask Lars about this simple convolutional network architecture.  Is it relevant (enough)?

- Implement ApplyFWD

- Implement ApplyBWD
   
- Likely sizing issues, such as the nchannels*nchannels assumption in 
   network.cpp::evalRegulDDT()

   Probably other sizing issues


- Dump MNIST data into a input files
